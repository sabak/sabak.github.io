## Overview

I teach and mentor at the intersection of **first-principles reasoning** and **practical iteration**. I focus on helping students and mentees build a repeatable process for solving hard problems—and the confidence to do it independently.

**What you can expect from my mentoring:**
- Structured problem-solving and first-principles thinking  
- Research workflow: baselines → hypotheses → experiments → ablations  
- Debugging (math + code) and clear communication of results  
- Independence: ownership, good habits, and momentum

## Undergraduate Mentoring

### Peer Mentor – C++ and Programming Abstractions (OOP)  
**Free University of Tbilisi** | Aug 2015 – May 2016  
- Mentored peers in **C++ fundamentals** and **programming abstractions** (data structures, recursion, decomposition)  
- Helped translate ideas into clean implementations: interfaces, invariants, and readable structure  
- Solved LeetCode-style problems weekly and reviewed solutions for clarity and correctness

## Physics Olympiad Coaching

### Physics Team Coach  
**42nd School of Physics and Mathematics, Tbilisi, Georgia** | Sep 2012 – May 2018  
- Coached students for national and international physics competitions  
- Students earned multiple medals in local and international contests  
- Led a team of 11 students to the **2016 International Zhautykov Olympiad** (Almaty, Kazakhstan)  
  - Team won **two silver medals** in both physics and mathematics  
- Ran weekly training cycles: timed attempts → solution post-mortems → targeted drills to close skill gaps

## Mentoring Philosophy

I mentor the way I like to learn: start from fundamentals, stay curious, and improve through practice and feedback. My goal is to help mentees build a process they can reuse across problems and projects.

I came up through competitive physics (bronze medals at **IPhO 2012** and **IZhO 2012**), which shaped my approach: clean reasoning, strong intuition, and deliberate practice. Now, in ML research engineering, I emphasize:

- Start with a simple baseline and a clear goal  
- Change one thing at a time; write down what you learned  
- Debug methodically (math, code, evaluation)  
- Communicate results clearly  

Ultimately, I want mentees to leave more independent—and more confident in their ability to figure things out.
