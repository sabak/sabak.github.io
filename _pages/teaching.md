## Mentoring Philosophy

My approach to teaching emphasizes building strong foundations while encouraging curiosity and independent problem-solving. Having competed in international physics olympiads myself (bronze medals at IPhO 2012 and IZhO 2012), I understand the challenges students face and the importance of developing both technical skills and physical intuition.
