## Overview

I enjoy teaching and mentoring at the intersection of **first-principles reasoning** and **practical iteration**. 

**I enjoy mentoring in:**
- Structured problem-solving and “first principles” thinking
- Research workflow: baselines → hypotheses → experiments → ablations
- Debugging (math + code) and communicating results clearly
- Building independence and ownership over projects

## Undergraduate Mentoring

### Peer Mentor – C++ and Programming Abstractions, OOP
**Free University of Tbilisi** | August 2016 - May 2016 

- Mentored peers in **C++ fundamentals** and **Programming Abstractions** (data structures, recursion, and problem decomposition)
- Helped students translate ideas into clean implementations: interfaces, invariants, and readable code structure
- Solved leetcode-style problems weekly

## Physics Olympiad Coaching

### Coach of Physics Team
**42nd School of Physics and Mathematics, Tbilisi, Georgia** | September 2012 – May 2018

- Coached high school students preparing for national and international physics competitions
- Students earned multiple medals in local and international competitions
- Led the school team of 11 students at the **2016 International Zhautykov Olympiad** in Almaty, Kazakhstan
  - Team was awarded two silver medals in both physics and mathematics
- Ran weekly training cycles: timed problem attempts → solution post-mortems → targeted drills to close skill gaps  



<!-- ## Mentoring Philosophy

I mentor the way I approach research and engineering work: build strong foundations, iterate deliberately, and make progress visible. My goal is to help people become **independent problem solvers** who can move from “I don’t know” to a working solution with clear reasoning and reproducible steps.

Having competed in international physics olympiads myself (bronze medals at **IPhO 2012** and **IZhO 2012**), I understand the value of intuition and rigor. I pair that mindset with a practical workflow that translates well to ML research and engineering:

- **Start with a baseline:** define the simplest working solution and what “good” means (goal/metric).  
- **Form hypotheses:** change one thing at a time; keep a written plan for what you expect to learn.  
- **Debug systematically:** isolate failure modes (assumptions, math, implementation, evaluation).  
- **Communicate clearly:** concise write-ups, results that answer a question, and honest limitations.  
- **Build ownership:** I gradually shift responsibility so mentees learn to design experiments, defend decisions, and ask better questions.

I aim to create a mentoring environment that is rigorous, supportive, and growth-oriented: high standards, frequent feedback, and a focus on transferable skills. -->
