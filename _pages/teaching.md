## Overview

I enjoy teaching and mentoring at the intersection of **first-principles reasoning** and **practical iteration**. 

**I enjoy mentoring in:**
- Structured problem-solving and “first principles” thinking
- Research workflow: baselines → hypotheses → experiments → ablations
- Debugging (math + code) and communicating results clearly
- Building independence and ownership over projects

## Undergraduate Mentoring

### Peer Mentor – C++ and Programming Abstractions, OOP
**Free University of Tbilisi** | August 2016 - May 2016 

- Mentored peers in **C++ fundamentals** and **Programming Abstractions** (data structures, recursion, and problem decomposition)
- Helped students translate ideas into clean implementations: interfaces, invariants, and readable code structure
- Solved leetcode-style problems weekly

## Physics Olympiad Coaching

### Coach of Physics Team
**42nd School of Physics and Mathematics, Tbilisi, Georgia** | September 2012 – May 2018

- Coached high school students preparing for national and international physics competitions
- Students earned multiple medals in local and international competitions
- Led the school team of 11 students at the **2016 International Zhautykov Olympiad** in Almaty, Kazakhstan
  - Team was awarded two silver medals in both physics and mathematics
- Ran weekly training cycles: timed problem attempts → solution post-mortems → targeted drills to close skill gaps

## Mentoring Philosophy

I mentor the way I like to learn: start from fundamentals, stay curious, and improve through practice and feedback. My goal is to help mentees build a repeatable process for tackling hard problems.

I came up through competitive physics (bronze medals at **IPhO 2012** and **IZhO 2012**), which shaped my approach: clean reasoning, strong intuition, and deliberate practice. As I am now in ML research engineering, I emphasize:

- start with a simple baseline and a clear goal  
- change one thing at a time and write down what you learned  
- debug methodically (math, code, evaluation)  
- communicate results clearly  

Ultimately, I want mentees to leave more independent and more confident in their ability to figure things out.
