I build machine learning systems for scientific and engineering problems, with a focus on scalable training on GPUs and HPC environments. My work spans neural networks, distributed training, and performance-oriented software development in Python (PyTorch, JAX) and C/C++.

I earned my PhD in Physics from Binghamton University, State University of New York, in 2024. My dissertation, “Machine Learning and ab initio insights into the design of lithium-based materials,” combined neural network potentials with density functional theory (DFT) to discover stable lithium-based compounds, with publications including *npj Computational Materials* and *Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics*.

I currently work as a Research Engineer in Pisa, Italy, applying machine learning to radar signal processing and target detection and building simulation frameworks for mono- and multistatic radar coverage analysis. I also have hands-on experience administering Linux HPC clusters and developing research software that runs reliably at scale.
