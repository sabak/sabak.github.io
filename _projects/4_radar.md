## Overview

As a Research Scientist at CNIT RaSS Lab in Pisa, Italy, I am currently applying machine learning techniques to radar signal processing and target detection systems.

## Research Areas

### ML for Target Detection
- Developing machine learning approaches for radar signal processing
- Applying neural network architectures to target detection problems
- Improving detection performance in challenging environments

### Coverage Analysis
- Building simulation frameworks for radar coverage analysis
- Modeling mono-static and multi-static radar systems
- Optimizing sensor placement and system configurations

## Skills Applied

- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, JAX for neural network development
- **Signal Processing**: Radar signal analysis and feature extraction
- **Simulation**: Building comprehensive radar system models
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization with pandas, NumPy
