## Overview

This project investigated the thermodynamic stability of Li-B-C compounds from first principles, with a focus on understanding the potential for superconductivity in this system. The work explored conditions for delithiation of LiBC parent material and identified favorable structural configurations.

## Research Focus

- **Li Chemical Potential Analysis**: Calculated Li chemical potential in Li<sub>x</sub>BC to estimate conditions required for delithiation
- **B-C Phase Examination**: Explained metastable BC<sub>3</sub> polymorphs with honeycomb and diamond-like morphologies
- **Evolutionary Optimization**: Employed optimization and rational design to identify Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>C configurations

## Methodology

- First-principles DFT calculations
- Phonon calculations in the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) framework
- Assessment of anharmonic effects on stability
- Analysis at varying volumes and pressures

## Key Findings

- Identified natural and favorable Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>C configurations
- Determined thermodynamic stability thresholds
- Gained insight into stability at varying volumes
- Quantified contribution of anharmonic effects
